# Smart-BP-application-v2

This project for created by Healthcare Engineering students from Aarhus School of Engineering.

The goal of this project is to create an application. The application must be able to show and analyse bloodpreassure in realtime (~10 times/sec).
Furthermore the bloodpreassure and analysis must be saved in a database with timestamp, notes and who's responsible for the measurement.
The system consist of a transducer in series with a amplifier and filter, which is connected to a NI-DAQ.
